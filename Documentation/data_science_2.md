## Getting Started

Data science often entails exploration of datasets. In this workshop we will be exploring a CSV published bt the Australian Government containing information about [pet registrations in the Surf Coast Shire](https://data.gov.au/dataset/632131eb-9233-41ef-9b33-61a82e3d6b80/resource/291c5a1e-88a8-4a6e-9555-81c4220e5dae/download/surfcoastshireregisteredanimals.csv).

## Step 0 (Getting Ready!)

1. Download the CSV of [pet registrations in the Surf Coast Shire](https://data.gov.au/dataset/632131eb-9233-41ef-9b33-61a82e3d6b80/resource/291c5a1e-88a8-4a6e-9555-81c4220e5dae/download/surfcoastshireregisteredanimals.csv).
