## Introduction to Data Science

Time Magazine publishes a list of the top 50 jobs in America, and number 1 is a Data Scientist. What is Data Science? How can we help introduce students to the field in our IT classrooms?

Data science is simply the act of exploring and extracting information from data. We are going to introduce some easy and fun ways to bring data science techniques into the classroom.

### Language and Envioronment:
* Python 3
* Google Colab Notebooks

### Victorian Curriculum Alignment
VCDTDI047:
  * Extracting specific data from an external source and storing it in a format that is more useful for analysis, for example combining mapping data from multiple electronic data sets to build a composite representation.

VCDTDI048:
  * Experiment with data visualisation techniques, identifying why certain visualisations are more appropriate for certain data sources.
  * Summarising data using advanced filtering and grouping techniques, for example pivot tables in spreadsheets and aggregation functions in databases.

VCDTDI049:
  * Examine the need for data security, legal liability, and responsibilities of engineers. (This content
will be part of the student edition workshops only).

VCDTCD050:
  * Define and decompose real-world problems precisely, taking into account functional and non-functional requirements and including interviewing stakeholders to identify needs

All of the code we will be writing in the data science part of the workshop will be done using [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/). These notebooks can be run anywhere with a browser, and don't require any special tools or installs.

You can use Google Drive to save the files, and you are even able to collaborate in real time with others.
